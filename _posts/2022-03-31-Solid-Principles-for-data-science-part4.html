  <h3> Interface segregation principle </h3>

  <p>
    This principle state that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. It means that if you want
    to apply ISP, you should split large interfaces into smaller and more specific ones so that object can use only
    interface they are interested about. It is one of the principle that is more and more used with the rise of
    microservices architectures.
