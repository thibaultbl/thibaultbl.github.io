  <h3> SOLID Principles </h3>
  <p>SOLID are a set of 5 principles intended to help the developers produce maintenable, readable and flexible
    code:

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>single-responsibility principle</li>
    <li>openâ€“closed principle</li>
    <li>Liskov substitution principle</li>
    <li>interface segregation principle:</li>
    <li>dependency inversion principle</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Single-Responsibility Principle </h3>

  <p>
    The main description of the SRP is often the following: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to
    change." </br>
    Depending on the person describing the principle the interpretation can be different.
    It is often interpreted as "every class should have only one responsibility." which is a really broad definition
    that can be difficult to apply in a real environment.

    I personally prefer the definition given by "Clean Architecture" of Robert Martin. He say that a module should only
    depend on a given group of person (in a typical company, a group of person may be given by occupations, like
    marketing, accounting, finance, ...).
    For instance, a module should have to change only if accounting change the way they are calculating some value of
    interest, but should never change if marketing change any of their process.

    <i>This principle is about people.</i>
  </p>

  <h3> Code example </h3>

  In the example below, we start with an implementation of a module used to compute the result of a marketing campaign.

  The problem is that

  <code class="language-python">
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from typing import Dict

    import pandas as pd
    from tabulate import tabulate


    # Bad implementation
    @dataclass
    class MarketingCampaignResult:
        number_of_publicity: int
        number_of_buy: int

        def total_cost(self) -> int:
            return self.number_of_publicity * 99

        # Will be used to compute the content of the report - used by finance
        def get_cost_detail(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
            total_cost = self.total_cost()
            cost_detail = {
                "creation": [total_cost * 0.25],
                "provider": [total_cost * 0.55],
                "human_ressource": [total_cost * 0.2]
            }
            return cost_detail

        # Will be used to display the report - used by marketing
        def display_report(self) -> float:
            df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(self.get_cost_detail())

            print(tabulate(df, headers='keys', tablefmt='psql'))


    marketing_report = MarketingCampaignResult(5, 3)
    marketing_report.display_report()

    # Good implementation - Separation in two modules


    # Will be used by finance
    @dataclass
    class MarketingCampaignCost:
        number_of_publicity: int
        number_of_buy: int

        def total_cost(self) -> int:
            return self.number_of_publicity * 99

        def get_cost_detail(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
            total_cost = self.total_cost()
            cost_detail = {
                "creation": [total_cost * 0.25],
                "provider": [total_cost * 0.55],
                "human_ressource": [total_cost * 0.2]
            }
            return cost_detail


    # Will be used by Marketing
    @dataclass
    class MarketingCampaignEfficiency:
        cost_detail: Dict

        def display_report(self) -> float:
            df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(self.cost_detail)

            print(tabulate(df, headers='keys', tablefmt='psql'))


    marketing_cost = MarketingCampaignCost(5, 3)
    cost_detail = marketing_cost.get_cost_detail()

    marketing_report = MarketingCampaignEfficiency(cost_detail)
    marketing_report.display_report()
