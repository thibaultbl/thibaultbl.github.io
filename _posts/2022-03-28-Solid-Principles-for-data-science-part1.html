  <h3> The three basics </h3>
  <p>In this post, I would like to get back really quickly to three basics of data science for projects that are built
    for production:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Logging</li>
    <li>Configuration file</li>
    <li>Unit Test</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Logging </h3>

  <p>
    Data Scientist use a lot of print statement when building a project, but there is a better way : logging. I use
    logging a lot to keep track of a project run state and to debug trouble in a project execution. I use mainly the
    logging module, but I am sure there is many other way to log the execution of a python project.
  </p>

  <h3> Configuration file </h3>

  <p>
    Every element that is subject to regular change but is not really code should be put in a configuration file. It
    allow the developer and every technical user of the project to bring change to the project without changing the
    code. I personally use dynaconf a lot, but again I am sure that there is many other python package.
  </p>

  <h3> Unit test </h3>

  <p>
    For every project that is built to be run in production for a long time and that should be improved regularly, it is
    really important to build unit test to allow quick change in the code of the project. I personally use pytest a lot,
    but ....
