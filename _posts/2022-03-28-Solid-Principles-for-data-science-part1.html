  <h3> SOLID Principles </h3>
  <p>SOLID are a set of 5 principles intended to help the developers produce maintenable, readable and flexible
    code:

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>single-responsibility principle</li>
    <li>openâ€“closed principle</li>
    <li>Liskov substitution principle</li>
    <li>interface segregation principle:</li>
    <li>dependency inversion principle</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Single-Responsibility Principle </h3>

  <p>
    The main description of the SRP is often the following: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to
    change." </br>
    Depending on the person describing the principle the interpretation can be different.
    It is often interpreted as "every class should have only one responsibility." which is a really broad definition
    that can be difficult to apply in a real environment.

    I personally prefer the definition given by "Clean Architecture" of Robert Martin. He say that a module should only
    depend on a given group of person (in a typical company, a group of person may be given by occupations, like
    marketing, accounting, finance, ...).
    For instance, a module should have to change only if accounting change the way they are calculating some value of
    interest, but should never change if marketing change any of their process.

    <i>This principle is about people.</i>
  </p>

  <h3> Code example </h3>

  <code class="language-python">
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from typing import Dict


    # Bad implementation
    @dataclass
    class MarketingCampaignResult:
        number_of_publicity: int
        number_of_buy: int

        def get_cost(self) -> int:
            return self.number_of_publicity * 99

        # Will be used by finance
        def get_cost_detail(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
            total_cost = self.get_cost()
            cost_detail = {"creation": total_cost * 0.25, "facebook": 0.25, "google": 0.3, "human_ressource": 0.2}
            return cost_detail

        # Will be used by marketing
        def get_efficiency(self) -> float:
            return self.number_of_publicity / self.number_of_buy


    # Good implementation - Separation in two modules


    # Will be used by finance
    @dataclass
    class MarketingCampaignCost:
        number_of_publicity: int

        def get_cost(self) -> int:
            return self.number_of_publicity * 99

        def get_cost_detail(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
            total_cost = self.get_cost()
            cost_detail = {"creation": total_cost * 0.25, "facebook": 0.25, "google": 0.3, "human_ressource": 0.2}
            return cost_detail


    # Will be used by Marketing
    @dataclass
    class MarketingCampaignEfficiency:
        number_of_buy: int
        number_of_publicity: int

        def get_efficiency(self) -> float:
            return self.number_of_publicity / self.number_of_buy
